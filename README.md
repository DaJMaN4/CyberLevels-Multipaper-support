# CyberLevels
Fork of cyberlevels with multipaper support

Do you need to change anything: You need to enable mysql

What works what doesn't work: Manual adding exp and level through commands when you are not on the same server doesn't work.

Extra information: Updating data with mysql Is not best optimize, if I will need to have better optimization of this plugin on my server then I remade it.

Data doesn't autosave when player is on the same server as the one ticking chunks, so you need to enable autosaving. 

Harvester plugin hook is deleted, I don't have api to that, if you want then just add the class and initiator from main repo.
